##1. Audio Book:
   Task to apply Text to Speech conversion and Extraction of Text from PDF files in the creation of an audiobook from a PDF file.

##2. Movie Recommenders:
  Applying Recommendation Engine concepts and techniques to a real-world Movie Recommender System.

  Building a Movie Recommender system with the following methods:

  1. Popularity
  2. Content Filter
  3. Collaborative Filter
  4. Matrix Factorization

##3. Cartoonify Faces:
  Applying Video processing and Face detection techniques to place a cartoon mask instead of your face in the video.

##4. News Modelling:
Topic modeling involves **extracting features from document terms** and using
mathematical structures and frameworks like matrix factorization and SVD to generate **clusters or groups of terms** that are distinguishable from each other and these clusters of words form topics or concepts

Topic modeling is a method for **unsupervised classification** of documents, similar to clustering on numeric data

These concepts can be used to interpret the main **themes** of a corpus and also make **semantic connections among words that co-occur together** frequently in various documents

Topic modeling can help in the following areas:
- discovering the **hidden themes** in the collection
- **classifying** the documents into the discovered themes
- using the classification to **organize/summarize/search** the documents

Frameworks and algorithms to build topic models:
- Latent semantic indexing
- Latent Dirichlet allocation
- Non-negative matrix factorization

##5. Object Segmentation:
  Extracting objects from background using Thresholding techniques.

##6. Prescription Parser:
  Create a Prescription Parser using CRF:

  Building a Prescription Parser that takes a prescription (sentence) as an input and find / label the words in that sentence with one of the already pre-defined labels.

##7. Summarization:
- concept of capturing very important gist of a long piece of text

#### Types of Summarization
- 1. **Extractive Summarization**
    - Select sentences from the corpus that best represent the text
    - Arrange them to form a summary
- 2. **Abstractive Summarization**
    - Captures the very important sentences from the text
    - Paraphrases them to form a summary
 
### Summarization Libraries
- Sumy
- Gensim
- Summa
- BERT **
    - BART **
    - PEGASUS **
    - T5 **


### 1. Sumy :
    1. Luhn – Heurestic method
    2. Latent Semantic Analysis
    4. LexRank – Unsupervised approach inspired by algorithms PageRank and HITS
    5. TextRank - Graph-based summarization technique with keyword extractions in from document

##8. Sentiment Analysis
  Using NLP techniques to classify a news headline containing financial information into either one of the sentiments (Positive, Negative or Neutral).

##9. Text Classification:
  This notebook outlines the usage of NLP Feature extraction (CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer) in classification of text documents

##10. Thief Detector:
  Building a motion detection algorithm that alarms you when you have an unwanted visitor in your home.
